### Program Guide (How to use)
```
0- Download the repo as zip file.

1- Uncompress in a known folder, and open the .xpr project file using Vivado.

2- Run simulation, or program it on an FPGA after configuring a constraints file to map the input and output, matching your FPGA.
```

### Project Status
- Instructions supported and passed initial testing: LW, SW, ADD, SUB, AND, OR, BEQ, LUI, AUIPC, JAL, JALR, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU, ADDI, SLLI, SLTI, SLTIU, XORI, SRLI, SRAI, ORI, ANDI, SLL, SLT, SLTU, XOR, SRL, and SRA.
- Instructions to be supported: LB, LH, LBU, LHU, SB, SH, ECALL, compressed instructions, and multiplication instructions.


### Challenges Faced
- Lack of sources explaining what signals and selection lines are produced and used

### Issues and Problems
- None faced in the currently supported instructions.
